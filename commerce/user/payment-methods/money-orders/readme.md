# Activating Money Orders as a Payment Method

Liferay Commerce has the option to enable sellers to accept money orders as a form payment. Once this payment method is activated, buyers will be able to use money orders. Sellers are highly encouraged to define and publish their store's policy on whether to accept money orders.

Besides activating Money Orders in the site settings, sellers can also create an article that documents their policies on accepting money orders on the _Payment Methods_ > _Configuration_ screen. The editor allows you to embed tables, images, and videos inside the article.

To start creating an article:

1. Navigate to _(your Commerce site) → Commerce → Settings → Payment Methods_.
1. In the _Message_ field, create an optional note about any specific policies on money orders.
1. Click the (+) sign at the left side of the _Message_ field. The menu gives editors the option to add an image, insert a link to a video, or insert a table, or a horizontal line break.
