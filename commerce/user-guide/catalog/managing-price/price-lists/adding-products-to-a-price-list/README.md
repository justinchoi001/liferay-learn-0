# Adding Products to a Price List

Once you have a [price list](../creating-a-price-list/README.md) created, you can add products to it. This article describes two ways to add products to a price list. Prices that are set via a Price List will take precedence over prices set directly against a given SKU for the associated users.

## Adding Products to a Price List Through the Price Lists Menu

When adding a large number of existing products to a new price list, populate the price list quickly using the following method:

1. Click _Add_.
1. Click on a product (_Premium Brake Fluid_ in this example).
