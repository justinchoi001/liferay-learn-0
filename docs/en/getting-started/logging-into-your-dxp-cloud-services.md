# Logging into Your DXP Cloud Services

By default, login is required to directly access the web interfaces for the DXP and Infrastructure services. Login credentials for these services are typically provided in an initial onboarding email - but may be located in the DXP Cloud Management Console if needed.

## Locating Login Credentials

1. Navigate to the _infra_ environment.
1. Click _Services_ in the left menu.
1. Select the _ci_ service.
1. Click the _Environment Variables_ tab.
1. Click _show_ icon next to `JENKINS_CUSTOMER_PASSWWORD` to retrieve the password.
1. Click _show_ icon next to `JENKINS_CUSTOMER_USER_NAME` to retrieve the user name.

1. This will redirect the user to the Liferay DXP 7.x instance (in this example, Liferay DXP 7.2 GA1).

Similar steps may be followed to access the Jenkins CI web interface.
