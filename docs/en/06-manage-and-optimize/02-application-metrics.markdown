## Advanced Application Metrics On Production

Before using the Dynatrace advanced monitoring features, the following requirements have to be met first:

* A Dynatrace account has been created.
* The Dynatrace secret `token` and `tenant` values have been generated.
* Dynatrace environment variables have been added to the `LCP.json` file in the DXP Service's production environment. For example:

```properties
"environments": {
  "prd": {
    "env": {
      "LCP_PROJECT_MONITOR_DYNATRACE_TENANT": "tot02934",
      "LCP_PROJECT_MONITOR_DYNATRACE_TOKEN": "dDKSowkdID8dKDkCkepW"
    }
  }
}
```

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
`LCP_PROJECT_MONITOR_DYNATRACE_TENANT` | A string with eight characters. It is part of the URL (prefix) of your Dynatrace SaaS account. |
