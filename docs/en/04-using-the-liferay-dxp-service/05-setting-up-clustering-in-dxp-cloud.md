# Setting Up Clustering in DXP Cloud

This article will outline the steps necessary to configure clustering for your Liferay DXP instance in DXP Cloud.

**Contents:**

1. [Enable the Clustering Environment Variable](#enable-the-clustering-environment-variable)
1. [Set the Clustering Scale](#set-the-clustering-scale)
1. [Add Clustering Portal Properties](#add-clustering-portal-properties)
1. [Deploy and Verify](#deploy-and-verify)

## Enable the Clustering Environment Variable

Start from the desired environment in the DXP Cloud console. Then, under `Services`, navigate to `liferay`, and then click `Environment Variables`. Set the `LCP_PROJECT_LIFERAY_CLUSTER_ENABLED` variable to `true`. This instructs the image startup process to add the clustering configuration to Liferay DXP.

## Set the Clustering Scale

Set the desired number of nodes for clustering by setting the `scale` property in `LCP.json` in the Liferay DXP service directory (`lcp/liferay/`).

```
{
  "kind": "Deployment",
  "id": "liferay",
  "image": "@liferay.workspace.lcp.liferay.image@",
  "memory": 8192,
  "cpu": 8,
  **"scale": 3,**
  ...
```

> **Note:** increasing the number of nodes for your Liferay DXP instance may increase the number of CPU cores allocated to your project. If the increased number of CPU cores exceeds the maximum for your plan, then the deployment may fail.

### Auto-Scaling

Auto-scaling works together with the `scale` attribute in `LCP.json`. If auto-scaling is enabled, then the `scale` property will determine the initial number of instances. The number of instances will then increase according to demand. See [Auto-scaling](../06-manage-and-optimize/03-auto-scaling.md) for more information.

## Add Clustering Portal Properties

By default, no extra portal properties are needed to enable clustering in DXP Cloud. The necessary configuration to set up clustering will already be copied to a `portal-clu.properties` and `unicast.xml` files in the Docker image when the Liferay DXP service starts up.

However, if additional portal properties for clustering are needed, then they can still be added into the repository. You can override the clustering-specific portal properties by adding them into the `portal-clu.properties` file within the `config` folder appropriate to the chosen environment. See [Configuring the Liferay DXP Service](./04-configuring-the-liferay-dxp-service.md) for more information.

## Deploy and Verify

Deploy the configuration changes to the chosen environment to verify that clustering was enabled. See [Overview of the DXP Cloud Deployment Workflow](../02-getting-started/05-overview-of-the-dxp-cloud-deployment-workflow.md) for more information.

To check if clustering is working correctly, check the logs of the Liferay DXP instances for the `Accepted View` message from the `JGroupsReceiver` class.

Here is an example in the logs of a successful deployment with clustering:
