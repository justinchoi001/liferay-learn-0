# Welcome to DXP Cloud

Liferay DXP Cloud is a secure and reliable enterprise cloud platform that 
provides the infrastructure and tooling necessary to simplify, secure, and 
deliver amazing applications on Liferay DXP.

Worry less and build more with a platform that provides:

* [Standards Compliant Security, Automated Backups, and Flexible Governance](#standards-compliant-security-automated-backups-and-flexible-governance)
* [High Availability, Scalability, and Performance](#high-availability-scalability-and-performance)
* [Real Time Alerts](#real-time-alerts)

All of which is designed, built, and supported by a dedicated team of 
Liferay professionals with a over a decade of experience running 
business-critical solutions on Liferay DXP. 

DXP Cloud accelerates application development and deployment by providing a 
complete DevOps CI/CD strategy, tools, and workflow. 

Every DXP Cloud project comes with: 

* [Accelerated Development with Built-in CI/CD](#accelerated-development-with-built-in-cicd)
* [Application Development Tools](#application-development-tools)
* [Insightful Monitoring](#insightful-monitoring)

## Standards Compliant Security, Automated Backups, and Flexible Governance

DXP Cloud is designed with security in mind. Build and deploy mission-critical 
sites with confidence knowing that DXP Cloud is **ISO 27001** and **AICPA SOC2** 
certified. See our 
[security policy](https://www.liferay.com/documents/10182/3292406/Liferay+DXP+Cloud+Data+Security+and+Protection.pdf/78ce7065-9787-1fb2-9c7b-6d7c13f4a3e6?t=1564674972483) 
for more information. 

[Automated backups](../platform-services/backup-service.md) 
ensure that data and documents are protected and ready for restoration in case 
of data corruption or failure. Encryption at rest ensures that sensitive data 
saved on disks isn't readable by any user or application without a valid key. 

![Figure 3: DXP Cloud's backup service preserves and protects your data.](./welcome-to-dxp-cloud/images/backups.png)

Out-of-the-box 
[role and team administration](../manage-and-optimize/team-collaboration-and-access-control.md) 
allows administrators to deliver maximum productivity and security by adding or 
removing people from teams and managing permissions per project environment.

## High Availability, Scalability, and Performance

[Clustering](../using-the-liferay-dxp-service/setting-up-clustering-in-dxp-cloud.md) 
and 
[load-balancing](../infrastructure-and-operations/networking/load-balancer.md) 
deliver highly available, zero-downtime deployments to ensure that 
mission-critical sites stay online. DXP Cloud delivers data through a 
multi-region architecture to ensure high availability. 

[Auto-scaling](../manage-and-optimize/auto-scaling.md) 
ensures that bandwidth and compute capacity is dynamically added to maintain 
steady performance through unexpected traffic spikes. Similarly, unneeded resources can be 
scaled down during periods of lower activity. Teams receive automatic 
notifications and email alerts regarding instance usage so they can manage 
resources with confidence.

## Real Time Alerts

Administrators can configure 
[alerts](../manage-and-optimize/real-time-alerts.md) 
per user to receive resource utilization updates in real-time.

## Accelerated Development with Built-in CI/CD

Deliver your application faster with a fully-realized CI/CD strategy available out-of-the-box. [Github and Jenkins](../build-and-deploy/continuous-integration.md) integrations allow each new commit or pull request to trigger a build that can be deployed to your [production or non-production environments](../build-and-deploy/environments.md). 

These robust systems enable the creation of fault tolerant processes 
to meet organizations' unique needs and detect and repair common server 
problems as they occur. This helps prevent small programming errors from 
accumulating and causing a server crash. 

![Figure 7: View, manage, and deploy your builds from a central location.](./welcome-to-dxp-cloud/images/builds.png)

## Application Development Tools

Keep track of application deployments and performance with real-time build and 
[deployment logs](../troubleshooting/log-management.md). Teams can analyze stack traces and troubleshoot bugs by 
[accessing the shell](../troubleshooting/shell-access.md) 
via the web console or terminal, and/or by downloading the logs. 

![Figure 8: Real-time build and deployment logs help you solve problems with your applications.](./welcome-to-dxp-cloud/images/build-logs.png)

## Insightful Monitoring

DXP Cloud delivers 
[application metrics](../manage-and-optimize/application-metrics.md) 
so IT teams can understand the health and compute requirements of their sites 
over time. Administrators can also use out-of-the-box 
[Dynatrace integration](../manage-and-optimize/application-metrics.md#advanced-application-metrics-on-production) 
to quickly understand CPU and memory usage, data transfer rates, and more.
