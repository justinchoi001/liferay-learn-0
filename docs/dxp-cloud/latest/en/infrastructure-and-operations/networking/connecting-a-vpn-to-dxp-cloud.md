# Connecting a VPN to DXP Cloud

You can use DXP Cloud's VPN feature to connect your DXP Cloud services to

DXP Cloud services to directories or applications that are only accessible on a 
company VPN. You'll learn how to do this here. 

## Connecting to a VPN

1. Go to your environment's *Settings* tab. 
1. Choose the type of VPN connection. Here are the supported types: 
    - OpenVPN
    - IPSec

    - **Server Address**: The server's address.
    - **Account Name**: The administrator's email address.
    - **Password**: The administrator's password.
    - **Certificate**: The certificate code.
    - **Forwarding IP**: The IP address.
    - **Forwarding Port**: The port number.
    - **Local Hostname**: The VPN's local hostname.
    - **Local Port**: The VPN's local port number.

1. Click *Connect VPN*. 

To disconnect your service from a VPN after it's connected, click the 
*Disconnect* button.
