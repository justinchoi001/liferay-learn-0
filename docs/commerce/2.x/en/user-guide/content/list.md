# List

The List Page is the page where buyers can create and view wish lists using the _Wish Lists_ and _Wish List Contents_ widgets.

The _Wish Lists_ widget shows a list of all created wish lists created by an authenticated user. The _Wish List Contents_ widget shows all products that have been added to a particular list.

Note that wish lists are scoped to be **site** specific; if a Liferay Commerce instance has more than one store site, wish lists are not transferred or saved across sites.
