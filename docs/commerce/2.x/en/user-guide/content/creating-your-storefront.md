# Creating Your Storefront

Building a store in Liferay Commerce requires more than a complete catalog. Store administrators building a storefront from scratch will need to add a series of pages to display and sell their products. This article serves as a reference for pages that may be created for a functional storefront.

Using an [Accelerator](../getting-started/accelerators.md), such as Minium will create these pages for the user. Liferay Commerce is built on Liferay DXP - click to learn more about [Creating Pages](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018171291-Creating-Pages).

The following types of pages may be created:

| Page Name | Purpose | Widget(s) Used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Account Management](../content/account-management.md) | Page where store administrators can manage Users and Accounts | _Accounts_ |
| [Catalog](../content/catalog.md) | Main page where customers can search for products and refine their search results. | _Search_, _Option Facet_, _Specification Facet_, _Category Facet_ and _Search Results_.|
| [Cart](../content/cart.md) | Displays all items in the shopping cart | _Cart_, _Cart Summary_, _Mini Cart_ |
| [Checkout](../content/checkout.md) | Displays a summary of all selected goods for purchase | _Checkout_ |
