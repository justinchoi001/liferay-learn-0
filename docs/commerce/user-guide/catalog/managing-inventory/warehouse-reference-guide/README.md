# Warehouse Reference Guide

Warehouses represent physical locations where product inventory is managed and shipped for order fulfillment. Store administrators set inventory quantities per warehouse. Available inventory is then calculated by Liferay Commerce to determine the total available inventory for sale across warehouses.

Liferay Commerce allows multiple warehouses across geographic locations.

To manage your warehouses, navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Settings_. Click the _Warehouses_ tab.
