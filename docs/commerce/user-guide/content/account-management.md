# Account Management

The Account Management page is where Store administrators and Account Managers manage Users and Accounts. Users may be invited to the store and assigned account-specific roles (Buyer, Sales Manager, Account Manager, and Sales Agent). Accounts may also be created on this page.

If using Minium Accelerator to create sample data, there is a site Navigation Menu where the _Account Management_ widget is located:

Once deployed to the page, the _Account Management_ widget lists all the accounts.
