# Applying Shipping Method Restrictions

You may need to apply a shipping restriction for your store to specific countries or regions. This means these countries are not available during the checkout process. These restrictions will apply to all shipping options for a particular shipping method. For example, restrictions applied to the _Flat Rate_ shipping method will not apply to the _Variable Rates_ shipping method.

To apply a restriction:

1. Navigate to the _Site Administration_ → _Commerce_ → _Settings_.
1. Click the _Shipping Methods_ tab.
1. Click any Shipping Method; in this example, _Flat Rate_.
1. Click the _Restrictions_ tab.
1. Click the (+) button to add a new restriction.
1. Check all the boxes for countries where you do not want to ship to; in this example; Antarctica and Bahrain.
1. Click _Add_.

Your store is now restricted from shipping to those countries. Repeat these steps for all the other shipping methods such as _Variable Rate_ and _FedEx_. If you are customizing Liferay Commerce by adding additional carrier shipping methods (UPS, DHL, and so forth) through an extension point, you may want to include the same function to restrict delivery by region.
